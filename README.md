# MyData
This watchOS application was built with an idea to help the user to load and save any of the desired data.

In this project, I learnt that all Apple platforms have a built in system called user default which has a capacity to save small amount of data such as storing preferences and other simple values. All these preferences gets loaded when the app starts. I learnt and used all the three ways of saving user data :

•	Reading and Writing Files

•	Reading and Writing from the Keychain

•	Reading and Writing User Settings
